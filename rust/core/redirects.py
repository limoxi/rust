    The 302 (Found) status code indicates that the target resource
    resides temporarily under a different URI.  Since the redirection
    might be altered on occasion, the client ought to continue to use the
    effective request URI for future requests.
    Note:
        For historical reasons, a user agent MAY change the request
        method from POST to GET for the subsequent request.  If this
        behavior is undesired, the 307 (Temporary Redirect) status code
        can be used instead.
